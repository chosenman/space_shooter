BUGS:

- width of iPhone window too low
- make window size conversion to adjust any devices displays;
- make disapearing "fire button" to make impossible pushing it too often. (to avoid zoom in on iPhone and to make more fair competition);
- workaround server/socket disconnecting of user:
	+ if user leaves battle field, redirect his opponent to dashboard
	+ if user leaves dashboard - update this info (without removing fightState variable)
